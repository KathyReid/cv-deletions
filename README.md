# Mozilla Common Voice Requested Deletions
This is a repository of hashed IDs requested for deletion from Mozilla Common Voice so that we can programmatically remove them.

* [`requested-deletions.tsv`](requested-deletions.tsv): This file contains the hashed IDs of the clips requested for deletion, and the Common Voice version after which they don't have to be checked against. For example, if they were present in version 9, but removed in version 10, then the version after which they don't need to be checked is `10`.
